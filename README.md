# Cloudappi Code Challenge - Front Junior - By Alberto Perez

## Test specifications
- Develop services (RESTful) in React to connect to the "backend"
[https://my-user-manager.herokuapp.com/users](https://my-user-manager.herokuapp.com/users)
- Develop an interface that allows you to list and view the details of the users.
- Patterns and style of front development. Good practices, cleanliness of the code.
- Layout of the project.

## Description of the application
Application to connect with an api and list the names of all users or the name of the user selected by id.
After listing the results, we can see the details of the user by clicking on the username link.
If the search was done by id, it directly shows the user's details
I include a button to create a new user and send it to the api.

I make the http requests with the Axios library and parse the result to return the correct data.
I have used Bootstrap to design the page. A minimalist and clear style.
